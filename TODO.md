- [ ] Change AppBar colors in WorkoutListScreen, WorkoutDetailScreen, and ScheduledWorkoutsScreen
- [ ] Update icons to professional ones (e.g., Icons.event for calendar, Icons.access_time for time, Icons.schedule for scheduling)
- [ ] Adjust card styles in WorkoutListItem and ScheduledWorkoutsScreen for subtle shadows and cleaner look
- [ ] Update button styles (ElevatedButton, TextButton) to use new color scheme
- [ ] Improve layouts: increase padding, better spacing in forms and lists
